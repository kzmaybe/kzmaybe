# 🏂  Hi, I'm Kevin Y Zhang!

I’m a **Software Engineer** with a background in **Hospitality Management** and **Computer Science**. My passion lies in **building applications that enhance people's quality of life**—whether it's optimizing travel rewards, creating efficient booking platforms, or developing AI-powered solutions.

I recently graduated from **UNLV with a degree in Computer Science** and am actively seeking a **Software Engineer Internship**. I enjoy working with **full-stack web development, AI tools, and cloud technologies**, and I'm always eager to learn new frameworks and collaborate on impactful projects.
